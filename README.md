### README for Fine-Tuning SCGPT with Galore

---

## Project Overview

This project involves fine-tuning the SCGPT (Single-Cell Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model using the Galore library for a specialized single-cell data analysis task. SCGPT is designed for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data, and leveraging Galore allows us to enhance its performance efficiently.

## Key Components

1. **SCGPT**: SCGPT is a transformer model pre-trained specifically for single-cell data, enabling advanced analysis and interpretation. It is designed to handle the unique challenges posed by single-cell datasets, such as high dimensionality and sparsity.
2. **Galore**: Galore (Gradient Low-Rank Projection) is a memory-efficient training strategy that facilitates full-parameter learning while significantly reducing memory usage. It is particularly effective in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages, outperforming traditional methods like LoRA in memory efficiency and performance.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to fine-tune the SCGPT model for a specific task in single-cell analysis. This involves training the model on a targeted dataset to improve its accuracy and utility for specialized applications.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare and format the single-cell dataset to be compatible with SCGPT.
2. **Model Initialization**: Load the pre-trained SCGPT model.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Utilize Galore to fine-tune the SCGPT model on the specific dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualization tools.

## Galore: An Overview

Galore, developed by researchers from institutions like Caltech and Meta, is a memory-efficient training method that uses gradient low-rank projection. It reduces the size of optimizer states by up to 65.5% while maintaining training efficiency and performance. This method is particularly useful for training large language models (LLMs) on consumer-grade hardware by minimizing memory consumption without sacrificing accuracy【20†source】【21†source】【22†source】.

## Results

After fine-tuning, the SCGPT model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics. Visual tools such as UMAP plots and confusion matrices are employed to illustrate the results, providing insights into the model's accuracy and classification abilities.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining SCGPT with Galore for specialized single-cell data analysis tasks. The fine-tuned model achieves enhanced performance with efficient memory usage, making it suitable for large-scale applications on more accessible hardware.
